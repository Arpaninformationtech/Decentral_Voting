# Decentralized Voting App

This repository contains the code for a decentralized voting application built using Solidity smart contracts and React.js for the frontend. The backend and frontend are connected using web3.js, and Ganache is used to fetch the account addresses.

## Features

- Secure and transparent voting process using blockchain technology.
- Decentralized architecture ensures immutability and tamper-proof results.
- User-friendly interface built with React.js.
- Integration with Ganache for testing and development purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- Ganache: [https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)




## Acknowledgments

- This project is inspired by the idea of decentralized voting systems.
- Special thanks to the developers and contributors of Solidity, React.js, web3.js, and Ganache for their excellent tools and libraries.
